## featurs 
so when a player is joining for the first time it will insert to the database his discord id if u ban him and he go create another discord account  and try to join with another discord on his carecthere is will drop him / kick him and log it to your discord logs 
else if he keeps join with his real discord it will let him in like nothing happened
